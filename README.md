General comments:
- Week 1 homework for Coding Bootcamp

What I learned:
- Thinking I know something is not the same as knowing something
- I don't yet have a best practice for commenting css or html files
- Don't update files under git control in more than one place - e.g. Readme on github and others locally. Not that I did that!
- For some reason git push dumps me into a vim file which I have to quit. Not sure why this is happening
- Thinking about the assignment before actually starting was helpful
- Just because the assignment looks daunting to start with, doesn't mean you can't do it. (see bullet above)
